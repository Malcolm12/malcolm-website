<p>As a classical musician with a diverse background in banking, event planning, and customer success.  I pride myself on having the entrepreneurial mindset ready to tackle challenges head on.  My past has developed my deep understanding of human interaction, which I hope to merge with technology in order to make a profound impact.  What excites me most is meeting new people to collaborate with to use technology to tackle the many problems that face us in modern society. Currently, I am enhancing my front end developer skills including HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. I am also learning about design principles, UX/UI, workflow, and other softer skills aimed at adding value at a tech startup on day one.I am looking to find the best start-up match that helps me expand in all ways necessary for my entrepreneurial development.  It would be awesome to work on projects that shift my perspective and let me see things in a new light.   </p>
